Use the Heartbeat runservice, its good for stuff like this. Ideally, you get their latest position and then check if their new position is much greater than usual

debounce = false
Check = false 
humanoidrootpart = Player.HumanoidRootPart
maxDistance = 44
RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function()
    if humanoidrootpart then
        if Check == false and debounce == false then	
            debounce = true
            LastestPos = humanoidrootpart.Position	
            wait(.1)
            Check = true
            debounce = false
        else
            if debounce == false then	
                local NewPos = humanoidrootpart.Position	
                if (LastestPos - NewPos).Magnitude > maxDistance then
                    -- KICKKKED 
                end	
                Check = false
        end
    end
end)
This checks if the player moves (maxDistance) in about a mili-second, if a lot then the person is teleporting or speed hacking, then you punish them however.
